- **User Registration**: Donors can register and log in to manage their donation activities.
- **Donation Logging**: Donors can log details of their donations, including categories such as cash, clothes, food, and necessities.
- **Status Tracking**: Organizations can update the status of each donation (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Scheduled for Pick-up, Complete, Canceled).
